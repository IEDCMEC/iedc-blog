What is the image that comes to your mind when you think of a good leader? Most of the time it would be of a rough and tough person, making decisions confidently without any doubts. The one who keeps all his emotions to himself and guides the team as though everything is good even at the time of crisis. It is a long time that this perception about a leader has to change. Leaders are after all human beings with their own emotions, fears, insecurities, anger, and happiness, as everyone else does. One would surely feel relaxed and more comfortable working in a team when you share your feelings and emotions with others in the team. This practice of emotional exposure is what is called vulnerability in leadership. A vulnerable leader can build trust and strong relationships among the team members. Simon Sinek, leadership expert and author, rightly quoted, “A leader, first and foremost, is human. Only when we have the strength to show our vulnerability can we truly lead.”
Vulnerability is often misunderstood as a weakness, a sign of incapability, or the chance for others to exploit you. However, vulnerability, in the context of leadership, refers to a willingness to show one's true self, including admitting mistakes, sharing fears and uncertainties, and acknowledging limitations. Vulnerability enables leaders to connect with their team members on a deeper level. By sharing personal experiences and challenges, leaders demonstrate empathy and understanding. It creates a sense of belonging, where team members feel valued and appreciated for who they are rather than solely for their contributions. When employees perceive their leader as empathetic, they are more likely to work actively, show interest in the activities of the organisation, and contribute to the overall success of the team.

Being vulnerable involves speaking about your emotions and prioritising mental health. It is okay to take a day off if you feel a mental burnout or want to get a self-care day. Trace Young, founder and CEO of a startup, shares her own life experience of how vulnerability in leadership made her a good leader in one of her TED talks. She initially felt that it was necessary to prioritise work above her own well-being. She made every effort to ensure that the company would be able to generate profits, just as it would have if it had a male CEO. She kept her struggles and physical health conditions during her pregnancy hidden from her team members, working as if everything was normal. On a later stage of her career as a leader, she realised that it was more important to express herself and be her true self as a leader and not try to imitate others to meet the so-called benchmark set for a CEO. She started to feel the difference in managing the team when she expressed her feelings and struggles with team members.
One of the many ways vulnerability can benefit leadership is by fostering trust and honesty in the team. Trust is the building block of any successful team. When a leader shares his challenges and risks and acknowledges his mistakes, it embraces transparency and motivates the team members to trust each other. They can easily relate to the struggles faced by the leader and the team and also feel free to express their concerns and emotions. This will greatly benefit the team in the long run.
Secondly, vulnerability enhances empathy. Vulnerable leaders always listen to the emotions, feelings, and concerns of the team members. This gives the leader a clear understanding of the strengths, weaknesses, struggles, and needs of each team member. Consequently, the leader can empathise more effectively and make decisions that consider the well-being of both the team members and the company. This would reduce the conflict between the company and the employees and create a sense of unity and shared purpose among the employees.
Moreover, a vulnerable leader is always ready to accept his shortcomings and ask for suggestions and ideas from the team members. This encourages the team members to contribute innovative ideas as they feel that their input is valued and that they won't be penalised for taking risks. This creates an environment where the team members are empowered to explore new and unconventional solutions without the fear of failure.
Further, a vulnerable leader is always ready to learn from his mistakes, seek help and advice from others, even from the team members, and is always striving for personal growth and development. The team members discover that it is acceptable to make mistakes when facing new challenges, which in turn motivates them to acknowledge their errors and acquire knowledge from them.
One should keep certain things in mind while practising vulnerability. In the first place, vulnerability without boundaries isn't vulnerability. One must know exactly what to share and what not to share with the team while practising vulnerability. It is not about burdening others with your problems but more about working cooperatively to find a solution to the problem. It’s fine to share a version of personal life problems with the team, but it’s not appropriate to repeatedly share about it, complain, or use it to excuse poor behaviour, for example, yelling at a team member. Next, being vulnerable does not mean you’re always sharing. Vulnerability also means you know when to step back, listen, and let go of some control. Furthermore, a leader should not refrain from asking for help while practising vulnerability. Asking for what you need is not a sign of weakness but rather a sign that you understand your workload and your team. It helps to move your projects forward, reduce delays because you’re getting the support you need, and feel that the work is equally distributed. Plus, every time we reach out to a colleague or team member to ask them for support, we are empowering them to step up and take control of the work.

In a nutshell, thinking that vulnerability makes a leader weak is not true. Instead, when leaders are open about their challenges, it can make them outstanding. Being a vulnerable leader has a lot of benefits that can eventually add to the productivity of the team. It creates an environment where the employees are free to express their emotions and challenges they face related to the work. Employees feel more connected to the team as well as the management, which motivates them to work honestly and sincerely. The practice of vulnerability also cultivates a team of courageous individuals who are willing to take risks and think creatively. 

The best leaders will be the ones who aren't scared to show their real selves, embracing their imperfections. Real strength comes from being brave enough to be vulnerable, and that's what makes a good leader a truly remarkable leader.
