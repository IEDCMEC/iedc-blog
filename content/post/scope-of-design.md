As a graphic designer and as a person, Harinarayanan explained that he needed stimulus and he used it to fuel his
creativity. By drawing lines of similarity between design and cooking, where we combine things, measure proportions, and
blend them to create something new, he explained how the abundance of stimulus around us can be used positively and in
favour of design.

There is power in design. From working as a designer in corporate and marketing fields, Harinarayanan talked about how
design is about manipulating people into making certain choices and it leaves you with an inflated ego. Engineering and
Design do go well together. You can utilise the fact that you’re an engineer to boost your design skills. There is a
need to look good and if you look at a lot of the companies in France or anywhere in the World, all of them have good
logos.

Most designers have humble beginnings and the speaker didn't have it any differently. He contrasted between his early
works that he started off by using Microsoft Powerpoint ( no shame in that ) and his best works to point out the
progress he made. From using oversaturated colours to finding the right colour palette, choosing the right fonts along
with giving more care for the layout to highlight and emphasis, there is a lot to be learnt and over time you will
develop your own set of unique practices.

To make the best use of your skills and creativity, you need the right tools. There are a lot of tools out there but
these are the most used and essential :

1. Canva - As much as you love making things from scratch, there are times when you just need to get the work done
   efficiently and at the same time deliver high quality designs without much effort. You may think that having
   ready-made design is disrespecting the whole process of design but, by using Canva and the wide range of features it
   has like templates, basic editing, and illustrations, you can make sure you are consistently creating and publishing
   your best work.
   1. Photoshop - One of the best design tools out there. The learning curve might be slow and hard to progress through in
      terms of the UI and the abundance of tools that are available, but once mastered, you won’t need anything else.
   2. Figma - It is useful for working with teams and making integrated designs like carousels for Instagram, UI/UX,
      colour-themed posters, etc. The UI is more simple and easier to understand, but not any less powerful.
   3. Blender - It is the best tool for 3d digital art and rendering. With the rise in value and popularity of NFTs,
      Blender has become one of the leading 3D design tools.

Developing an eye for the finer details of the design aspects around us and realising the thought and process that went
behind every element is the main takeaway from the session.
